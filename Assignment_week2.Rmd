## About Me

Hey there, Joly here.
I am having lots of fun learning the Data science course and completing this assigment on a late night of July 21st, 2019.

How are you doing? :)

## My Awesome Leaflet

```{r , echo=FALSE}

library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=43.1594, lng= -79.2469, popup="My Office")
my_map
```
